NYT-React-Search

Check out this mockup image. This explains how your site's components should function.
Create a MongoDB database called nytreact.
Using mongoose, then create an Article schema and model
Articles should have each of the following fields:
title (Title of the stored article from nytimes.com)
date (publish date and time of the article)
url (URL of the article on nytimes.com)
Creating documents in your articles collection similar to
 {
   title: 'Ali Sells Jersey House And Moves to Chicago',
   date: '1974-07-18T00:00:00Z',
   url: 'http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A0DE5D8173FEF34BC4052DFB166838F669EDE'
 }
Create a Node/Express/MongoDB/ReactJS app called nytreact. This will be a recreation of the NYT Articles Search exercise application we built back in Week 6. Running this application will:
Create a Bootstrap layout similar to that displayed in HW_Assignment.png. This should be a SPA (Single Page Application) that uses react-router to navigate, hide and show your React components without changing the route within Express.
If you want to try out another CSS framework, feel free to use an alternative to Bootstrap.
You'll need several Express routes for your app:
/api/saved (get) - your components will use this to query MongoDB for all saved articles
/api/saved (post) - your components will use this to save an article to the database
/api/saved (delete) - your components will use this to delete a saved article in the database
* (get) - will load your single HTML page (with ReactJS) in public/index.html. Make sure you put this after all other GET routes
The layout should include three React Components named Main, Search and Saved.
Main - contains the main-container div that holds the main layout and navigation. This component should also be able to hold sub-components Search and Saved
Search - queries the NYT API for articles. Displays API search results from another possible Query component and Results component. Gives the user the ability to save an article to their Saved Articles.
Saved - displays the Saved Articles that were searched and stored in the database
Deploy your application to Heroku once complete.
Bonus Live Updates to Saved Articles

Use React routing and socket.io to create a notification or a component that triggers whenever a user saves an article. Your message should include the title of the saved article.
Say you have multiple browsers open, each one visiting your site. If you save an article in one browser, then all of your browsers should notify you that a new article was saved.
Socket.io NPM package
